## Discord

Discord bot is a QoL improving bot for the community Discord server.
For example, giving the "Community member" role to newcomers.

## Twitch

The Twitch bot is very basic, still trying to understand the twitch API.
Planning to make it a moderator, and vanity bot.
Example command, is `!dice` which returns a number between 1-6 and sends it to the chat.
